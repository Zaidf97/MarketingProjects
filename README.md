# MarketingProjects

Hi, Welcome to my project workspace.
I am Zaid FAROOQUI, an M1 student at EDHEC Business School, France. I am interested in marketing and I have carried out various projects in the same domain over the course of the last few months. The folder below contains my work. I am currently working on more projects and I will keep updating this workspace.


Procter and Gamble: 

This project is one of my works the closest to my heart. Being my first deep dive into the FMCG industry, I realised the  marketing plans behind the simple products such as a dishwasher, or a razor is so complicated. The psychology of consumer behaviour and the purchasing methods are deeply integrated to our mind sets, and marketers need to make the best use of that.
Here, I created an end-end marketing strategy plan for the PnG Product Fairy and its performance and continued success in the French market. The project starts by introducing the current and future market trends and highlighting how the trends has changed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and how it continues to grow and stagnate further. Performing a Consumer Perception analysis through a survey taken in the big retail chains and performing internal and external analysis gave us key insights into the product and PnG too.
Moving further, STP is carried out. A target persona is created and a value positioning is created for the same. Later, 4P analysis is performed, focusing heavily on Place and Promotion, identifying what key locations PnG needs to target and channels one can use for better promotion.
