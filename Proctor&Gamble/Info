This is the intermediary report I prepared for the PnG product Fairy. Fairy is a dishwashing tablet introduced in the French Market a while back. Our aim with this project was to identify the market and the competition, where we performed Customer Insight, market trend analysis along with Internal analysis of the company and the product itself.
We further moved on to create the STP and value positioning for the product. Aftet extensive survey, we found a target group and created an ideal persona to target upon whom we based our value positioning.

Moving further, we performed the 4P analysis, focusing on the promotion and place. We performed a delivery channel analysis to identify key channel partners and delivery model in each case
